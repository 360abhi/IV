op 10 JavaScript Interview Questions & Answers

1Ô∏è‚É£ What are the data types in JavaScript?

Primitive: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint

Non-primitive: object, array, function

2Ô∏è‚É£ Difference between var, let, and const?

var: Function-scoped, hoisted, can be redeclared.

let: Block-scoped, not redeclared, can be updated.

const: Block-scoped, cannot be redeclared or updated.

3Ô∏è‚É£ What is hoisting?

JS moves variable and function declarations to the top before execution.

Example: Functions can be called before declaration.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Difference between == and ===?

==: Compares values after type coercion.

===: Compares values without type conversion (strict).

5Ô∏è‚É£ What are arrow functions?

Shorter syntax for functions, no this binding.

Example: const add = (a,b) => a + b;

6Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between null and undefined?

null: Intentional absence of value.

undefined: Variable declared but not assigned.

7Ô∏è‚É£ What are closures?

A closure is a function that remembers variables from its outer scope even after the scope is closed.

Example:

function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() { count++; return count; }
}
const counter = outer();
counter(); // 1


8Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous JS?

Synchronous: Executes line by line, waits for tasks to finish.

Asynchronous: Uses callbacks, promises, async/await to avoid blocking.

9Ô∏è‚É£ What is event bubbling and event capturing?

Bubbling: Event starts from target element and goes up to root.

Capturing: Event starts from root and goes down to target.

üîü What is this in JavaScript?

Refers to the object that is executing the current function.

In strict mode, in a function this is undefined.
