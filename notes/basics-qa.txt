**1. What is the difference between Verification and Validation?**
**Answer:**

* **Verification** ensures the product is designed to deliver all functionality to the customer ("Are we building the product right?"). It is process-related.
* **Validation** ensures the product actually meets the customer’s needs ("Are we building the right product?"). It is product-related.

**2. What is STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)?**
**Answer:** A sequence of specific activities conducted during the testing process:

1. Requirement Analysis
2. Test Planning
3. Test Case Development
4. Environment Setup
5. Test Execution
6. Test Cycle Closure

**3. Difference between Sanity and Smoke Testing?**
**Answer:**

* **Smoke Testing:** Basic tests to check whether the build is stable.
* **Sanity Testing:** To check the new functionality or bug-fix doesn’t break existing features.

**4. Functional vs Non-Functional Testing?**
**Answer:**

* **Functional Testing:** Testing features or functions of the software (e.g., login, registration).
* **Non-Functional Testing:** Testing performance, usability, scalability, load, etc.

**5. What is Regression Testing?**
**Answer:** Re-running previously executed test cases to ensure that the new code changes haven't broken any existing functionality.

**6. What is the difference between Test Case and Test Scenario?**
**Answer:**

* **Test Case:** A detailed set of steps to validate a specific function or feature.
* **Test Scenario:** A high-level concept of what to test.

**7. What is the difference between Severity and Priority?**
**Answer:**

* **Severity:** Impact of the defect on the application.
* **Priority:** Order in which the defect should be fixed.

**8. What is a Test Plan?**
**Answer:** A document detailing the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of intended testing activities.

**9. What is a Bug Life Cycle?**
**Answer:** The journey of a bug from identification to closure:

1. New
2. Assigned
3. Open
4. Fixed
5. Retested
6. Closed
7. Reopened (if failed again)

**10. What is Black Box Testing?**
**Answer:** Testing the application without knowledge of internal workings. Focuses on input and output.

**11. What is White Box Testing?**
**Answer:** Testing internal logic, code structure, and flow.

**12. What is Exploratory Testing?**
**Answer:** Simultaneously learning, test design, and execution with minimal planning.

**13. What is UAT (User Acceptance Testing)?**
**Answer:** Final phase where real users test the system to ensure it meets requirements.

**14. What is Boundary Value Testing?**
**Answer:** Testing at the edge of input ranges. E.g., if the range is 1–10, test with 0,1,10,11.

**15. What is Equivalence Partitioning?**
**Answer:** Dividing input data into valid and invalid partitions to reduce total test cases.

**16. What is Risk-Based Testing?**
**Answer:** Prioritizing tests based on risk of failure and impact.

**17. What are Entry and Exit Criteria?**
**Answer:**

* **Entry Criteria:** Conditions to begin testing (e.g., code freeze, test environment ready).
* **Exit Criteria:** Conditions to stop testing (e.g., 95% test cases passed).

**18. What is Defect Leakage and Defect Density?**
**Answer:**

* **Defect Leakage:** Defects that passed to production undetected.
* **Defect Density:** Number of confirmed defects per lines of code/module.

**19. What is Difference between QA and QC?**
**Answer:**

* **QA (Quality Assurance):** Process-oriented, focuses on defect prevention.
* **QC (Quality Control):** Product-oriented, focuses on defect identification.

**20. Agile Testing vs Traditional Testing?**
**Answer:**

* **Agile Testing:** Continuous testing during development.
* **Traditional Testing:** Testing after development phase is completed.
